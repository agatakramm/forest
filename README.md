# Fire in the Forest

## About the Project
This program generates a GIF animation depicting a cellular automaton named 'Fire in the Forest,' created by Pierre Audibert. It allows users to specify grid dimensions, cell size, delay between images, and other options via command-line arguments. Currently, the program implements the first part of the functionalities described in the document found at the following address: [feudeforet.pdf](http://www.pierreaudibert.fr/tra/feudeforet.pdf).

This project is open for collaboration. I invite you to contribute to its development by following the comprehensive description provided in the document mentioned above.
